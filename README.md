# Function plotter app

This is the repository for code used in [a Shinyapp to plot function curves](https://napoleongl.shinyapps.io/function_plotter/) using gglpot2.

Potential future features include 
* being able to add up to 8 functions in one plot using buttons to add/remove textInputs
* migrating the plot to plotly instead to allow zoom etc
